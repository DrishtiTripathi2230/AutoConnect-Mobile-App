  ## 🚕 AutoConnect – India’s Inclusive Local Transport App

AutoConnect is a **mobile-first UI/UX prototype** designed to connect passengers with nearby **local transport drivers** such as **auto rickshaws, e-rickshaws, cycle rickshaws, and single-engine bikes**.

The app focuses on **simplicity, inclusivity, safety, and trust**, making it suitable for users with **low digital literacy**, while also empowering local drivers with a **fair and commission-free platform**.

## 📌 Project Overview

India’s local transport ecosystem is diverse but fragmented. AutoConnect brings all commonly used **short-distance transport options into one simple app**, designed specifically for Indian users.
